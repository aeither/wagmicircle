## Description

Wagmi Circle is a socialfi platform that allows users to discover and share knowledge, send and receive tips, and access cross-chain transaction history. With Wagmi Circle, users can connect with like-minded individuals, learn from a community of experts, and earn rewards for their contributions.

## Problem

1.	Lack of a social platform for sharing knowledge and learning from others in the crypto community.
2.	Limited options for earning rewards for contributions to the community.
3.	Difficulty in accessing cross-chain transaction history in a centralized and user-friendly manner.

## Solution:

1.	A social platform that allows users to acquire knowledge, read news, and access 
2.	Easily check cross-chain transaction history.
4.	A social onboarding wallet that allow sign up with Web2 experience.

### Cross-chain transaction checker

```tsx
    const [bscResponse, goerliResponse, ethResponse] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(BSC_TESTNET_URL, bscOptions),
      fetch(ETH_GOERLI_URL, ethOptions),
      fetch(ETH_MAINNET_URL, ethOptions),
    ]);

    const bscResult =
      (await bscResponse.json()) as GetTransactionByHashResponse;
    const goerliResult =
      (await goerliResponse.json()) as GetTransactionByHashResponse;
    const ethResult =
      (await ethResponse.json()) as GetTransactionByHashResponse;

    const transactions: Transaction[] = [];

    if (bscResult.result !== null) {
      transactions.push({
        ...bscResult.result,
        chain: "bsc",
      });
    }

    if (goerliResult.result !== null) {
      transactions.push({
        ...goerliResult.result,
        chain: "goerli",
      });
    }

    if (ethResult.result !== null) {
      transactions.push({
        ...ethResult.result,
        chain: "eth",
      });
    }
```
